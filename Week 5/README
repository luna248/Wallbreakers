Q. Course schedule:
  For this problem, I have used Kahn's topological sort algorithm.
  To implement it, I have used the following data structures:
    1. Adjacency list: To create a directed graph
    2. List: To keep track of dependencies
    3. Deque: To eliminate vertices
  Process:
    * Start with vertices with no incoming edges
    * Process them, remove them (from the deque) and process their outgoing edges from the graph
    * Continue with this process till there's nothing left in the graph

Q. Island Perimeter:
  I thought this problem could be solved much faster with an algorithm not using graphs.
